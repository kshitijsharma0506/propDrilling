Component Composition :-- moving one component logic ie the return state from shop.jsx to the App.jsx where the variable is first passed. the issue is this way all the code will come in App.jsx no bad approach.

Context API :- Create a context value and we wrap the context value around all the components import { createContext } from 'react';
